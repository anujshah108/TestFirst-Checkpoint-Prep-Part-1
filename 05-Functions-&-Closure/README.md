#05-Functions-&-Closure
<hr>

###Overview

As some of the previous TestSpecs demonstrated, Functions are just Objects.  The following TestSpecs will cover this idea even further while demonstrating other features of functions.  The concepts we will explore are:

- [Arguments Variable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments)
- [Higher Order Functions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)
- [Scope](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/04/javascript-variable-scope-this/) 
- [Closure](http://javascript-roadtrip-part3.codeschool.com/levels/2)
- Call Stack
