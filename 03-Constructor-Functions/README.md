#03-Constructor-Functions
<hr>

###Overview

In 02_Calculator you created a function that returned a Calculator Object.  RPN Calculator will introduce a new type of function called a `Constructor Function` that creates a new object when invoked with the `new` operator.  

Using the new pattern described above, you will create an RPN Calculator object that functions just like an RPN Calculator.  You will also be exposed to the `.prototype` property on Function objects and see how it behaves when used with the `new` operator and a `Constructor Function`.
